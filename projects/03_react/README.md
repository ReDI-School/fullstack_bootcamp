### 1. Introduction

This project will guide you through some basic and intermediate React features. You will develop a clone of Twitter (or X) using React, JSX, NPM, and Vite. Specifically, you will build a responsive web application that includes basic tweet functionalities, user interactions, and real-time updates.

> You can start this project by setting up a new React application with Vite and follow the milestones to implement various features step-by-step.

### 2. Project Summary

The main objective is to create a functional clone of Twitter (X) using React. You will develop an application where users can read tweets, post tweets, and interact with them using React hooks and state management.

### 3. Milestones & Acceptance Criteria

**1. Milestone: Application Composition and Initial Scaffolding**

**What you do**: Set up a new React application using Vite. Create the initial project structure and develop basic components such as the tweet input form and the tweet list using `useState`.

**What you learn**: React basics, JSX syntax, project scaffolding with Vite, component creation, and state management.

**Deliverables**:

- A new React project scaffolded with Vite.
- Basic components for the tweet input form and tweet list.
- Implementation of `useState` to manage tweet input and display.

**2. Milestone: Implementing Hooks and Completing Components**

**What you do**: Implement additional React hooks to enhance functionality. Complete the development of all necessary components, including tweet interactions (like, retweet, etc.).

**What you learn**: Advanced React hooks, component lifecycle, and interaction management.

**Deliverables**:

- Updated React components with advanced hooks.
- Fully functional tweet input, tweet list, and interaction components.
- Test the components' interactions in the browser.

**3. Milestone: Making the Application Responsive**

**What you do**: Ensure the application is fully responsive. Implement responsive design techniques and test the application on various devices and screen sizes.

**What you learn**: Responsive design principles, CSS-in-JS (styled-components or similar), and media queries.

**Deliverables**:

- Responsive design for all components.
- Testing and validation of responsiveness on different devices.
- Ensure smooth and consistent user experience across all screen sizes.

**Bonus Milestone: Rebuilding the Application with Next.js**

**What you do**: Recreate the entire application using Next.js to take advantage of server-side rendering and other advanced features.

**What you learn**: Next.js basics, server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.

**Deliverables**:

- A new project scaffolded with Next.js.
- Reimplementation of all components and features.
- Comparison and testing of performance and functionality between the Vite and Next.js versions.

### 4. Technical Explanation

Vite: Read the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to understand how to set up and configure your project.

### 5. Learning Objective

At the end of the project, you should:

- Feel comfortable using React and JSX to build dynamic web applications.
- Understand state management with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Be able to implement responsive design using CSS in React and media queries.
- Gain experience with Vite for fast project setup and development.
- Explore Next.js for server-side rendering and other advanced web development features.

### 6. Hints, Tips, and Further Readings

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

### 7. Hand-in Requirements

At the end of the project, you will submit your completed Twitter clone, including all source code and project files. The final product should demonstrate a clear understanding of React principles, responsive design, and state management.

To turn in your project, you must complete the deliverables of milestones 1 to 3. The BONUS Milestone is optional but recommended for advanced learning.
