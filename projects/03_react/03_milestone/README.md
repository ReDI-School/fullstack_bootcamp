# 3. Milestone - Achieving Full Device Compatibility

### Milestone 3 - Achieving Full Device Compatibility

### Objective:

Ensure that your Twitter clone application delivers a seamless and optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes.

### Requirements:

1. **Responsive Design Implementation:**
    - Utilize CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styles for various screen sizes.
    - Ensure that all components, including the header, sidebar, tweet input, and tweet list, are fully responsive.
2. **CSS-in-JS or Styled Components:**
    - Apply design adjustments using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion, or traditional CSS media queries as preferred.
3. **Extensive Device Testing:**
    - Test the application on multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
    - Verify that the layout adapts seamlessly, providing a consistent user experience across all devices.
4. **Enhanced User Experience:**
    - Improve usability on smaller screens by optimizing touch targets, font sizes, and other interactive elements.
    - Implement a collapsible sidebar for mobile view to conserve space.

### Additional Guidelines:

- Maintain a clean and modular CSS structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Use flexbox or grid layouts to create flexible and adaptive layouts.
- Ensure images and other media elements are adaptive and maintain the layout integrity.

### Example CSS and Media Queries

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
