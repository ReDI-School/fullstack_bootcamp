### 1. Introduction

This project will guide you through some basic and intermediate JavaScript features. You will add interactive functionalities to an existing HTML/CSS e-commerce site using JavaScript with your IDE (see later). Specifically, you will enhance an e-commerce site with functionalities like generating DOM elements, sorting products, and adding products to the cart.

> You can start this project from the e-commerce template provided in the previous module or use the new HTML/CSS source provided to implement the JavaScript functionalities.

### 2. Project Summary
