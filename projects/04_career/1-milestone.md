## Milestone 1
### What you will do:
In this milestone, you'll explore the current job market by researching relevant roles, analyzing their requirements, and identifying key skills. Compare these skills with your own to see where you’re strong and where you need growth. From there, create a professional development roadmap to guide your learning during and after the bootcamp. Additionally, you'll clarify the specific areas where you want to apply, solidifying your career ambitions. Finally, reflect on your professional identity to craft a personal brand statement that highlights your strengths and career goals, positioning you effectively for future job opportunities.

### You will learn more about:
- Job Landscape
- Job Profiles in the web development industry
- How to search for jobs
- Personal Branding

### Task 1: Set up Your Board on Miro

Follow the Loom instructions to set up your workspace:
- Create an account on [Miro](https://miro.com).
- Create a new Miro board.
- [Upload this template to the board](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/projects/04_career/Miro%20Template%20for%20Exercise%201) and lock it

### Task 2: Work at your Professional Development Roadmap on Miro
Following the steps listed both the template itself and here below:
- Step 1: Dentify Job Profiles & Requirements: start by gathering and analyzing at least 5 job listings for roles that interest you. Since you might have several types of roles in mind, it’s a good idea to prioritize just one job profile to focus on for this exercise. This will help you dive deeply into understanding the skills and requirements of that role.
  
Note: If you’re interested in exploring multiple job profiles, you can certainly repeat this exercise for other roles by duplicating the template, creating a version for each profile you want to investigate. However, it’s only necessary to complete the exercise for one profile for now.
- Step 2: Categorize the Skills Needed: You should look for common requirements and skills listed in these postings and group them in the board. After that, assess your current level for each of the skills listed
- Step 3: Carry out a SWOT Analysis
- Step 4: Set specific goals: Use sheet 3 to organize your action points in a timeline divided into short, medium, and long-term goals.
- Step 5: Reflect on your values and create your personal brand statement
