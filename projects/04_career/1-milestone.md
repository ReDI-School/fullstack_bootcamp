## Milestone 1
### What you will do:
You will learn about the job market and potential careers available. You also understand in which direction you can develop your career moving forward. You learn more about your own profile by carrying out a SWOT analysis and developing your own brand statement.

Once you have a direction (the job profile you aspire to) and are aware of your current profile and capabilities, you will understand what skills and knowledge to develop further and create a professional development roadmap for yourself.

### You will learn more about:
- Job Landscape
- Job Profiles in the web development industry
- How to search for jobs
- Personal Branding
