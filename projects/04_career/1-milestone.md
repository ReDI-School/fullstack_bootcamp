## Milestone 1
### What you will do:
You will learn about the job market and potential careers available. You also understand in which direction you can develop your career moving forward. You learn more about your own profile by carrying out a SWOT analysis and developing your own brand statement.

### You will learn more about:
- Job Landscape
- Job Profiles in the web development industry
