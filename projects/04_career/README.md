# Career Development Project

## Project Goal
This program aims to develop skills that prepare you for finding a job in tech. The selection processes you are going to face can be as diverse as the companies. In this program, we compile the most important topics and the most common stages that we have identified in our experience, always trying to make it as up-to-date as possible.

In order to find a job, you will need to acquire the knowledge and tools that we will share with you, in addition to what you can search for on your own with our guides. Also, you will put your skills into practice through activities and simulations of the selection process.

## Milestones

You'll learn the steps of the job application process, from the introduction meeting to the technical interview! You will practice your skills through assigning you a technical assignment and a mock technical interview.

## Activities
The program has several stages (as usual: one milestone per week) that will allow you to prepare yourself for the job search. In each module you can find:

- **Content**: Informative pieces on a specific topic on Gitbook. These videos, infographics, audios, etc., are inputs that you can consult for the progress of the program.
- **Workshops**: Each week on Tuesday, you will have the chance to attend one career workshop, one for each of the project milestones.
- **Project deliverables as a result of individual activities**: Dynamics that will lead you to reflection and will test your acquired skills to prepare for the job search. Those need to be delivered to the mentor 24 hours in advance of each mentoring sessions.
- **Mentoring**: Each week you will have space to interact with a mentor, to get support in and finalise each milestone. At the end of the career project, we request you upload all milestones on Google Classroom.
