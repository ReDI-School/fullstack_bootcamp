# **Teacher Guide â€“ Recap: Milestones 1, 2, and 3**

## **Introduction**

This guide is designed to help you recap the core concepts covered in the first three Milestones of the React Bootcamp. It also provides tips for reviewing student projects and encouraging further exploration.

---

## **Teaching Objectives**

1. **Reinforce Core Concepts**:
   - Ensure students understand functional components, state management, and data-driven UIs.

2. **Evaluate Project Progress**:
   - Review how students applied concepts like state (`useState`) and filtering in their e-commerce app.

3. **Encourage Creativity**:
   - Challenge students to enhance their projects with optional features, such as icons or animations.

## **Milestone-by-Milestone Summary**

### **Milestone 1: Introduction to React**

- **Objective**: Introduce students to React and the component-based architecture.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Functional components.
  - The importance of breaking UIs into reusable pieces.
- **Student Outcomes**:
  - A basic React app with a `Header` and `ProductCard` components.

### **Milestone 2: State Management and Event Handling**

- **Objective**: Teach students how to manage state and respond to user interactions.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - `useState` hook for managing local state.
  - Prop drilling to pass data between components.
- **Student Outcomes**:
  - An interactive e-commerce app with a working shopping cart.

### **Milestone 3: Search and Filters**

- **Objective**: Enable students to filter and search through data dynamically.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Using `filter()` and `includes()` for search functionality.
  - Managing multiple state variables for combined filtering logic.
- **Student Outcomes**:
  - A `Filters` component for search and category selection.

## **Classroom Flow**

### **1. Reviewing Concepts**

- **Activity**: Break the class into small groups to discuss:
  - How they structured their components.
  - Challenges they faced and how they resolved them.

- **Discussion Prompts**:
  - What is the purpose of the `useState` hook?
  - How does React's component structure improve scalability?

### **2. Code Review**

- **Activity**: Choose one or two student projects to review as a class.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Are the components reusable and logically separated?
  - Is the filtering logic efficient and clean?

### **3. Exploring Challenges**

- **Activity**: Introduce the optional challenges and discuss:
  - How to add icons to the dropdown menu in the `Filters` component.
  - Where to include the loading spinner and how to style it.
  - How to highlight products dynamically based on their category.

## **Best Practices to Highlight**

1. **Component Reusability**:
   - Emphasize the importance of breaking down UI into smaller, reusable components.

2. **Clean Code**:
   - Encourage students to use meaningful names for variables and functions.
   - Highlight the importance of separating logic from presentation.

3. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Suggest using browser developer tools to debug state and props.
