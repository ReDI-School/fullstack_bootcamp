## **🛠️ Key Teaching Objectives**

1️⃣ **Explain Next.js File-Based Routing**  
   - Ensure students understand how the `app/` directory automatically defines routes.
   - Highlight the difference between **static and dynamic routes**.

2️⃣ **Introduce API Routes & Data Fetching**  
   - Guide students through **server-side API handling**.
   - Differentiate between **SSR, SSG, and CSR** in Next.js.

3️⃣ **Demonstrate UI Design with Tailwind CSS**  
   - Encourage students to use **utility classes** instead of traditional CSS.
   - Discuss responsive design principles.

4️⃣ **Implement Authentication & State Management**  
   - Help students grasp **how authentication works in Next.js**.
   - Walk through global authentication handling using **context providers**.

## **📌 Classroom Flow & Teaching Strategies**

### **1️⃣ Next.js Fundamentals**
#### ✅ **Teaching Next.js Routing**  
- Demonstrate how the **file-based routing system** works.
- Guide students through **creating dynamic pages**.

**Example Exercise:**  
Ask students to **create a dynamic profile page** (`user/[id]/page.js`) that fetches and displays user data.

---

### **2️⃣ Tailwind & UI Improvements**
#### ✅ **Teaching Tailwind CSS Basics**
- Start by showing **basic utility classes**.
- Encourage **hands-on practice** by letting students modify existing styles.

**Discussion Prompt:**  
Why is Tailwind CSS more **efficient than traditional CSS frameworks** like Bootstrap?

---

### **3️⃣ API Integration & Authentication**
#### ✅ **Teaching API Routes & Authentication**
- Explain how **API routes in Next.js** function like a mini backend.
- Walk through authentication logic using **NextAuth.js**.

**Example Debugging Exercise:**  
Give students a **broken login function** and ask them to **fix it**.

---

## **Common Student Challenges & Solutions**

❌ **Issue 1: Confusion Between SSR, SSG, and CSR**  
💡 Solution: Use a **comparison table** to differentiate them.

❌ **Issue 2: Forgetting to Configure Tailwind Correctly**  
💡 Solution: Remind students to check their `tailwind.config.js` and `globals.css` files.

❌ **Issue 3: Authentication Not Persisting**  
💡 Solution: Ensure students understand **state persistence and context providers**.
