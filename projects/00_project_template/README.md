# Project Template

## Briefing
1. What is the project template? The project template describes the setup of a project. It provides further descriptions about every section. 
2. Why projects? We foster project based learning. Students learn concepts by applying them in a project. We believe in learning by doing.
3. How are the projects set up? Students work on a project for four weeks. Each week they work on one milestone. The last week is for recaping and finishing the project. Students who are further advanced work on the BONUS milestone.
4. How to use the project template? We have a project outline we want to fill out for every project. This project template describes what to fill into every section
5. Why is the project description so important? We want the students to work on the projects as autonomous as possible. The project is supposed to be understandable without a person introducing it.
6. How to get started?
   I. Create a copy of the template 
   II. Fill out every section of the template for the project you are setting up.
   III. Add boilerplate code to the project folder so that it is easier for the students to get started ([look at this project for boilerplate code](https://github.com/Laboratoria/curriculum/blob/v8.6.0/projects/00-trivia/README.md)).
   IV. Test the project with community members for understanding and clarity.

## 1. Introduction
Let's introduce the student to the project. What is the content of the project? Why is super cool to work on it and why is it relevant?

Please add an image / picture to the project introduction to make the project more engaging :) 

## 2. Project Summary

- What are the students exactly doing? 
- What are the main learning objectives of the project?

## 3. Milestones & Acceptance Criteria
We split the project into three milestones. Which are describing our acceptance criteria. All three should to be finished when handing in. There is a fourth milestone which is a BONUS one.
We aim to describe every milestone as clearly as possible so that students can follow the steps or know how to work on the milestone independently.

## 4. Technical Explanation

- work environment: How do you work? Which IDE you use, how you set up your computer,...
- If this is the first project with the setup, let's give some more links on how to set up the environment, etc. These descriptions can be in gitbook.

## 5. Learning Objective
- tools, languages used, processes

## 6. Hints, tips and further readings

- links to gitbook and other resources
- complementary youtube videos? 

## 7. Hand-in requirements
