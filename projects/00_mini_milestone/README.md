### 1. Introduction

Create a simple landing page for the marketing agency "BrightSpark" using HTML and CSS. The goal is to design a visually appealing page that clearly communicates the agency's services and encourages visitors to get in touch.


### 2. Project Summary

You will create a landing page for a fictional marketing agency called "BrightSpark". To create the landing page for the marketing agency, they have shared their target audience with us. The target audience includes:
- Small Business Owners: Entrepreneurs or owners of small businesses looking for marketing services to grow their business and enhance their online presence.
- Startups: New companies seeking marketing strategies and solutions to effectively launch their products or services.
- Freelancers: Individuals needing help building their brand and reaching a broader audience through targeted marketing.
The landing page should be designed to appeal to these groups by highlighting the agency's services and providing a clear call to action for consultations.
