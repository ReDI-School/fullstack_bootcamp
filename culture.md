What the ReDI values mean to us:

### Reliable
It means trustful in relation to the scope of our actions. We want to deliver the highest-quality learning services to our learners because they are relying on us for their education and deserve high-quality training from professionals like you.

### Helpful
It is helpful in the sense of impact. We are a community moved by the wish to help others grow and are actively oriented towards this goal. Being helpful means trying to generate a real change in the lives of others. 

### Caring 
We are "partners in crime" for our community, empowering them to do things they didn’t even think they’d be capable of at the beginning. It means empowering others to understand they can cross their own limits, far beyond what they might have originally thought. Change is also reflected in the students by the teachers because, through their flexibility and willingness to change, they are leading students to achieve their goals.

### Playful
This is the most important value and concerns experimenting in a fun and playful fashion. It refers to trying out new things and, if need be, making mistakes together and learning from them. It also means trying to build the "ideal learning environment" we all want to have in our own personal experiences.
