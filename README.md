## The Bootcamp 
ReDI's Full Stack Bootcamp is a program focusing on modern web development using React and Next.js. Our curriculum is structured around three major projects, each designed to build practical, real-world development skills. Each project consists of four milestones that allow students to progressively build their understanding and capabilities.

## Overview

The bootcamp consists of three main projects:

### Project 1: React Foundations

![REACT](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/assets/51905839/1b14fb79-3ffc-46c5-94c2-7bd44b7e140d)

Dive into modern React development, learning component architecture, state management, and UI design. You'll build responsive interfaces using React and Tailwind CSS, master hooks and context management, and understand essential React patterns and best practices. This project establishes the foundation for building dynamic, interactive web applications.

**Learning Goals:**
- Master React fundamentals and component architecture
- Understand state management using hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Learn modern styling with Tailwind CSS
- Build responsive and interactive user interfaces
- Implement component composition and reusability
- Handle user events and form management
- Understand React's virtual DOM and rendering lifecycle

### Project 2: Full-Stack Integration

Build upon your React knowledge by integrating Next.js and MongoDB into your applications. Learn server-side rendering, database integration, and API development. This project introduces you to full-stack development, teaching you how to handle data persistence, manage server-side operations, and create secure, scalable applications.

**Learning Goals:**
- Understand Next.js and server-side rendering
- Master data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR)
- Learn MongoDB database design and operations
- Implement CRUD operations through API routes
- Handle server-side state and data persistence
- Create and manage API endpoints
- Understand data modeling with Mongoose

### Project 3: Advanced Development & Deployment

Master advanced aspects of web development including authentication, security, and deployment. Learn how to optimize application performance, implement proper security measures, and deploy your applications to production. This project focuses on the real-world aspects of launching and maintaining web applications.

**Learning Goals:**
- Implement user authentication and authorization
- Master security best practices and data protection
- Learn deployment strategies and optimization
- Understand environment configuration
- Implement error handling and logging
- Use SSH for secure server management
- Master Git workflow and collaboration

## 4. Project: Career Preparation
![CAREER](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/assets/51905839/f19035a3-e624-4258-b90a-0936f661423b)

In the final project, you create a powerful LinkedIn profile, CV, and portfolio, work on a case study, and learn how to apply for your first job.

**Learning Goals:**
By the end of this module, you should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:
- `LinkedIn`: Create and optimize a LinkedIn profile based on industry feedback.
- `CV`: Update and refine CV with professional feedback.
- `Professional Identity`: Sharpen and articulate a clear professional identity.
- `Coding Challenge`: Complete and review a coding challenge to showcase technical skills.
- `Application Process`: Understand and navigate the job application process.
- `Mock Interview`: Participate in a mock interview to receive feedback and improve performance.

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure:
- Four progressive milestones (3 core + 1 bonus)
- Hands-on implementation of concepts
- Real-world application of skills
- Peer review and feedback
- Expert coaching support

## Resources

- [ReDI School Website](https://www.redi-school.org/)
- [Gitbook](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/fullstack) 
- [Projects](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp)

## Evaluation

Student progress is evaluated through:
- Completion of project milestones
- Code reviews and peer feedback
- Practical implementation of concepts
- Final project presentations

Each milestone builds upon the previous one, and students receive feedback from coaches at each stage. The focus is on practical skills and real-world application rather than theoretical knowledge alone.


## Final words

Mastering front end and full stack development is a challenging journey, but with the right resources and guidance, it's definitely achievable. This curriculum is designed to support your ambition. Feel free to use it to your advantage. If you find any areas for improvement, please let us know or contribute with a pull request. Best of luck on your path, and happy coding!
