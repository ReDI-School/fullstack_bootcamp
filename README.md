## The Bootcamp 
ReDI's Full Stack Bootcamp is a part-time (20 hours per week) bootcamp lasting for 18 months. It has a strong focus on front end and gives an introduction to back end elements. The goal is to support participants prepare for an internship in the industry. 

Our learning approach builds on learning by doing. Students work on three hands-on projects throughout the bootcamp. Each project lasts 4 weeks and contains 3 Milestones plus a Bonus Milestone. We aim to be as close as possible to a real work environment where juniors receive deliverables, work on them, run into issues, seek support and present their solutions to seniors. Students work in peer to peer sessions, in small groups with coaches and in input sessions with experts. However, the majority of the workload is the actual project work where students individually progress their project by working on the weekly milestone. 

## Overview

ReDI's Full Stack Bootcamp curriculum consists of 4 modules, spread over 18 weeks. In the following diagram you'll find the sequence of all the modules included:

## Evaluation
During the course of each project, coaches will individually monitor your work. Each week students finish one milestone. They receive feedback and support by Coaches in the Monday Support Session. However, the milestones are not evaluated. 

Students hand in their project at the end of each project cycle. Relevant for the evaluation are the deliverables per milestone. Remember that the learning objectives are more important than the completeness of your project. 

At the end of your project, you present your work to the coaches and will receive feedback. Before this session, you will need to reflect and self-evaluate against the learning objectives. In this feedback session, you will validate your self-evaluation with your coaches. If some objectives have not been met, the coaches may recommend to proceed to achieve the missing learning objectives, which could involve continuing with the current project (more time) or doing a complementary project. Remember that everyone learns at their own pace, and it is important to gradually acquire the skills associated with the learning objectives. Your coaches and peers are there to support you.


## Final words
Mastering front end and full stack development is a challenging journey, but with the right resources and guidance, it's definitely achievable. This curriculum is designed to support your ambition. Feel free to use it to your advantage. If you find any areas for improvement, please let us know or contribute with a pull request. Best of luck on your path, and happy coding!
