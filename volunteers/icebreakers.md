# Ice Breakers

As the host/owner of the session, you can use quick ice breakers at the start of your sessions to energize participants, build connections, and create an engaging and interactive learning environment. Here is a list of Ice Breakers. They shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to run. 

### 1. Two Truths and a Lie

- **Description:** Participants share three statements about themselves—two true and one false. The group has to guess which one is the lie.
- **How to Run:** Use breakout rooms or chat for smaller groups, or let everyone participate in the main room.
- **Objective:** This ice breaker helps participants get to know each other in a fun way and stimulates conversation.

### 2. Virtual Scavenger Hunt

- **Description:** Give participants a list of items to find in their home within 1-2 minutes (e.g., something red, something that makes noise).
- **How to Run:** Ask them to bring the items back to the camera and share a quick story about one of them.
- **Objective:**  This activity energizes participants physically and mentally by getting them to move and engage with their surroundings.

### 3. Emoji Reactions

- **Description:** Pose a question or statement (e.g., "How are you feeling about today’s session?") and ask participants to respond using emojis only.
- **How to Run:** Use the chat or reaction tools available in most video conferencing platforms.
- **Objective:**  This quick check-in helps gauge the mood of the group and encourages participants to express themselves in a lighthearted way.

### 4. Five-Finger Poll

- **Description:** Ask participants to rate a statement or question using their fingers (e.g., "On a scale from 1 to 5, how familiar are you with today’s topic?").
- **How to Run:** Participants can hold up their fingers on camera or use the chat to share their number.
- **Objective:**  This quick activity gives immediate feedback on participants' current knowledge or feelings, helping the teacher tailor the session accordingly.

### 5. Quick Poll or Quiz

- **Description:** Launch a quick poll or a multiple-choice quiz related to a fun fact or topic from the session. Include a mix of serious and humorous questions to engage participants.
- **How to Run:** Use the polling feature available in most video conferencing tools, or use platforms like Kahoot or Mentimeter for more interactive quizzes.
- **Objective:** This activity is great for engaging participants right from the start, setting the stage for interactive learning, and assessing prior knowledge or opinions on the session’s subject.
