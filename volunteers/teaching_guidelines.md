# Teaching Guidelines


### How to Recap
We aim to start the session by reviewing the last week's concepts and milestone.  


### How to Introduce Theory

#### How little is enough? 
As educators, we want to give as little input and as little theory as possible. Ask yourself: how little is enough? We try to give only the necessary input so that the students can grasp a concept on a level that is relevant to them. As educators, we try to get off the stage and stop talking. We want to put the student and their coding practice in the center. Ask yourself: How little is enough?

#### Context before content
We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help solve a bigger problem.

#### Practice over Theory
We believe that learning how to code is best learned through coding. We aim to move fast from the theoretical to the practical part (How to Practice) to discuss the theoretical concepts in live code. 


### How to Practice

#### I Do, We Do, You Do
We recommend the concept _I do, We do, You do_ for live exercises in class. That means you start by showing one example (I do). Secondly, you ask the class to code along a second example (We do). Thirdly, you ask the class to try out one example by themselves (you do).
- **I do:** In this phase, the teacher models how to complete a task or solve a problem. The teacher may use think-aloud, demonstrations, or other methods to show the students how to do the task. The preferred teaching technique for _I DO_ is Live Coding. It involves walking through each line of code and physically writing each line to show how it is written. This is particularly good for new students, as it’s good to see in practice how the code is written, and it takes away some of the "Code Scare" effects when writing code for the first time. This is good when you involve the students in the process by acting as the “hands,” and they are the “brain” telling you what to type.
- **We do:** In this phase, the teacher and the students work together to complete the same task or solve the same problem. The teacher provides support and guidance as needed, but the students actively participate in the task.
- **You do:** In this phase, the students work independently to complete a similar task or solve a similar problem. The teacher provides feedback and support as needed, but the students are responsible for completing the task independently.
The goal of the “I do, we do, you do” strategy is to gradually shift the responsibility for learning from the teacher to the students. Students can build their skills and confidence over time by starting with explicit instruction and modeling, moving to guided practice, and finally to independent practice.

#### Hand out Broken Applications/Code
A good approach to make students more able to get programming concepts is to let them have problems, be stuck, and have to look for solutions on the internet. Just let them search for a way to repair something.
