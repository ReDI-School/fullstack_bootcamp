# Teaching Guidelines

## Teaching Method: I Do, We Do, You Do

The "I Do, We Do, You Do" method is a teaching methdo designed to help students learn new concepts by first observing, then practicing with guidance, and finally working independently. 

- **I Do:** The teacher demonstrates the task while explaining the steps and thought process out loud. This stage is all about modeling the correct way to approach the task, making sure to highlight key concepts and techniques.
- **We Do:** The session owner walks the students through an activity. The students follow along (code or design along). This collaborative stage allows students to apply what they've seen with support, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback.
- **You Do:** Students work independently on the task. This stage allows them to practice the skill on their own.


**Example: Introducing Javascript**

- **I Do:** The teacher introduces JavaScript and demonstrates a simple script that shows an alert when a button is clicked. Key concepts like variables, functions, and events are explained briefly.
- **We Do:** The teachers walks the students through creating a function that changes a heading's color when a button is clicked. The students follow and code along. The teacher shares their screen and give the students time to code along. Together the teacher and the students write the function, select the element, and add an event listener, with the teacher guiding and asking questions to engage students.
- **You Do:** Students independently write JavaScript to change the text of a paragraph when a button is clicked in a breakout room. They practice using variables, functions, and event listeners, then share their work for feedback.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Context before content** - We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help to solve a bigger problem
- **Engage with Students:** Ask questions to check understanding. Use their names and keep the tone friendly and encouraging.
- **Be Prepared, but Flexible:** Have a plan but adapt based on student needs.
- **Feedback is Key:** Provide constructive feedback to help students improve. Celebrate small wins to keep motivation high.
