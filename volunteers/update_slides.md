# How to Update Slides

We use Slides in the Input Session. The session owner leads the input sessions and can change the slides however they like. The slide deck ReDI is providing is a suggestion and a solution you can use. However, you have the creative freedom to change it how you like it. 

You can find the Slide Decks in Google Drive. The link is pinned in your Slack Channel.
