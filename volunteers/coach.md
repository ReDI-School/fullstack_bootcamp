# Coach
As a coach you join the Monday Support session. The coaching takes place in small groups. 1 coach looks after 5 students. During the 2-hour coach the group of students showcases the solution of the weekly milestone with the guidance from the coach. 

# Review Guide 
There are five points we think are essential to good feedback in ReDI.

### 1. Positivity
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes, but it’s important to give positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the trainee more confident. We also learn from what we did well.

### 2. Specific
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible, so the trainee knows which part of the code needs improvement.

### 3. Suggestions
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. In this way, the trainee will have ideas on how to improve the code. You push them in the right direction. Keep in mind the balance between suggestions and self-study; giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do.

### 4. Balance in amount of feedback
Too little comments and a trainee doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from, too much feedback and the trainee is overwhelmed by all the information. As a rule of thumb, we say that a normal review is somewhere between 10 and 15 comments. When you have a feeling that a trainee needs more guidance, feel free to contact them on Slack to plan an online call! If a trainee does everything well, tease them with more advanced topics!

### 5. Summary at the beginning
When you finished your review, we recommend to write a small summary at the top, where you:
- give a compliment to the students;
- let them know if they need to make changes;
- reflect upon the topics for that week and whether you think they understood well
