# Coach
As a coach, you join the [Coaching Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/support_session.md) on Monday from 19:00-21:00. The coaching takes place in small groups. One coach looks after 4-5 students. During the 2-hour session, the group of students showcases the solution of the weekly milestone and receives feedback and support from the coach.

## How to run the Coaching Session

**Before the Session:**
1. Review the milestone of the week to understand what students were working on. You can find the milestones in the specific [project](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/tree/main/projects). Check what deliverables the students have in their weekly milestone. These deliverables are supposed to be completed until the Coaching session. 
2. Open the Students & Project Milestones (2nd tab in your Core Sheet). The link to your Core Sheet is pinned in Slack. 

**In the Session:**
1. Join the Zoom Call 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Claim Host (Check out the pinned Guide in Slack on how to do so).
3. Wait until 19:05 to give everyone a chance to arrive and kick-off. You can use [Coaching Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dmqKmogq0h0jlT72YHExxUzFRTWN4UrTPIISnyQnUXg/edit#slide=id.g2ea1f48da22_0_0) to introduce the coaching session.
4. Open 5 breakout rooms. Every student group joins their respective breakout room, and the coaches distribute themselves to the breakout rooms.
5. In the breakout room, every student has 5 minutes to present. Afterward, the coach and other students have 10 minutes for Q&A and help the student further progress or finish with their solution. Then, the next student presents. 

**After the Session:**
1. Track the students' progress in your breakout room in the Students & Project Milestones tab (2nd tab of Core Sheet).

## Review Guide 
There are three points we think are essential to good feedback in ReDI.

1. **Positivity**
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes, but it’s important to give positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the students more confident. We also learn from what we did well.

2. **Hands-on**
In the [Coaching Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/support_session.md), you have the chance to give hands-on help with the code. During the session, you can revise one or two comments with the students directly using pair programming. We have 10 minutes per student for comments and support. 

3. **Suggestions**
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. This way, the students will have ideas on how to improve the code, and you will push them in the right direction. Keep in mind the balance between suggestions and self-study; giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do.

## FAQ

- _How do students present their milestones?_ Ideally, students first show the UI of their solution. Secondly, they walk you through the code.
- _What if we finish early?_ No problem! If you see that some students still don't feel very comfortable with the milestone or haven't finished it, you can use the rest of the time to help them drive the milestone.
- _What if the students didn't finish their weekly milestone?_ This can happen. Try to support the students by showing them how to finish the milestone. The students will start a new milestone on Tuesday. However, they can finish their milestone in the recap week before handing in the project.
