# Coach
As a coach, you join the [Monday Support session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/support_session.md). The coaching takes place in small groups. One coach looks after 4-5 students. During the 2-hour session, the group of students showcases the solution of the weekly milestone and receives feedback and support from the coach. 

## How to run the Support Session

**Before the Session:**
1. Review the milestone of the week to understand what students were working on. 
2. Open the Student Progress sheet (link in Slack). 

**In the Session:**
1. Join the Zoom Call 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Claim Host (Check out the pinned Guide in Slack on how to do so).
3. Wait until 19:05 to give everyone a chance to arrive and kick-off.
4. Open 5 breakout rooms. Every student group joins their respective breakout room, and the coaches distribute themselves to the breakout rooms.
5. In the breakout room, every student has 5 minutes to present. Afterward, the coach and other students have 10 minutes for Q&A and help the student further progress or finish with their solution. Then, the next student presents.

**After the Session:**
1. Track the progress of the students in your breakout room in the progress sheet (link in Slack).
2. Track student attendance 


## Review Guide 
There are five points we think are essential to good feedback in ReDI.

**1. Positivity**
It can happen easily that feedback only points out the mistakes, but it’s important to give positive feedback as well. Commenting on aspects that you liked about the code is crucial to make the students more confident. We also learn from what we did well.

**2. Specific**
Try to make your feedback as specific as possible so the students know which part of the code needs improvement.

**3. Suggestions**
Good feedback contains suggestions for improvement. This way, the students will have ideas on how to improve the code, and you will push them in the right direction. Keep in mind the balance between suggestions and self-study; giving away the solution is not always the best thing to do.

**4. Balance in the amount of feedback**
Too few comments, and a student doesn’t have enough feedback to learn from; too much feedback, and the student is overwhelmed by all the information. As a rule of thumb, we say that a normal review is somewhere between 5 and 10 comments. When you feel that a student needs more guidance, feel free to contact them on Slack. If a student does everything well, tease them with more advanced topics!

**5. Hands-on Support**
In the [Support Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/support_session.md), you have the chance to give hands-on help with the code. During the session, you can revise one or two comments with the students directly using pair programming. We have 10 minutes per student for comments and support.
