# Q&A Session 

## Overview
- **Intention:** Students get support in second half of the week and can ask questions.
- **Desired Outcome:** Students progressed in the project, solved their issues. 
- **Agenda:** 1) Students hand in questions on Slack 2) Teacher streams answering them.
- **Roles and rules:** Every student needs to put in at least two questions. One teacher is responsible for answering.
- **Timeline:** 60 min session on Thursday. 



## Questions:
- How can students take the most out of the support with the limitation on teacher capacity we have? 
- What if the teacher cannot solve the question?
- Until when do students need to hand in their questions?
- What to do if there are NO questions? Or too many?
- What if the question is a technical one? Like setting something on their laptop? WE ASK THEM TO SHARE A SCREEN RECORDING.
- Do we want to ask the students to hand in at least 2 questions?
- Voting system?
- Tool: Zoom. The session is being recorded so that students can check out the answers afterward.
