## How to run the Support Session

**Before the Session:**
1. Review the milestone of the week to understand what students were working on. 
2. Open the Student Progress sheet (link in Slack). 

**In the Session:**
1. Join the Zoom Call 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Claim Host (Check out the pinned Guide in Slack on how to do so).
3. Wait until 19:05 to give everyone a chance to arrive and kick-off.
4. Open 5 breakout rooms. Every student group joins their respective breakout room, and the coaches distribute themselves to the breakout rooms.
5. In the breakout room, every student has 5 minutes to present. Afterward, the coach and other students have 10 minutes for Q&A and help the student further progress or finish with their solution. Then, the next student presents.

**After the Session:**
1. Track the progress of the students in your breakout room in the progress sheet (link in Slack).
2. Track student attendance 

## Last Support Session of the Project
In the last support session of the project, the students present their full project. The students have 5 minutes to present their full project. Afterward, the coach and other students can give feedback and ask questions about the solution. 


## FAQ
- _How do students present their milestones?_ Ideally, students first show the UI of their solution. Secondly, they walk you through the code.
- _What if we finish early?_ No problem! If you see that some students still don't feel very comfortable with the milestone or haven't finished it, you can use the rest of the time to help them drive the milestone.
