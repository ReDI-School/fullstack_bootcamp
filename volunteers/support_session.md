## Last Support Session of the Project
In the last support session of the project, the students present their full project. The students have 5 minutes to present their full project. Afterward, the coach and other students can give feedback and ask questions about the solution. 


## FAQ
- _How do students present their milestones?_ Ideally, students first show the UI of their solution. Secondly, they walk you through the code.
- _What if we finish early?_ No problem! If you see that some students still don't feel very comfortable with the milestone or haven't finished it, you can use the rest of the time to help them drive the milestone.


❤️ Thank you for supporting the students' progress ❤
