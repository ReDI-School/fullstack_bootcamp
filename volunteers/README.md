Welcome to ReDI School! We really appreciate that you are part of our community. In this repo, you'll find an overview of the different volunteering positions. By volunteering, you contribute to our main goal: help our students gain the necessary skills to find a job in tech. ReDI School has now helped over 600 students find work. This is only possible with the support of our volunteers <3
