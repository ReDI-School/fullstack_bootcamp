# Volunteer Guide
Welcome to ReDI School! We really appreciate that you are part of our community. In this repo, you'll find an overview of the different volunteering positions. By volunteering, you contribute to our main goal: help our students gain the necessary skills to find a job in tech. ReDI School has now helped over 450 students find work. This is only possible with the support of our volunteers <3

# Curriculum
The curriculum is meant to prepare the students for a front end internship and help them grow into junior full stack or front end positions.

The bootcamp fully focuses on hands-on work through projects. Students work on three technical projects and one career project in the bootcamp. Each project lasts for four weeks. The first three weeks are "Regular Weeks", where students learn about a new topic and have a weekly milestone to complete. The last week serves as a recap week. Students finish their projects, the covered content is recapped in the input session, and more advanced students can work on the bonus milestone.
