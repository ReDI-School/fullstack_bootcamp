# Session Owner

## Introduction 
The Session Owner prepares and runs the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md) on Tuesdays. 

## How to run the Input session as Session Owner

**Before the Session:**
1. Check the class feedback form from the previous class before the session (Slack)
2. Coordinate with the teaching assistant to align needs
3. Upload class slides to Google Classroom as pdf 24h ahead of the session

**In the Session:**
1. Joins class as co-host 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Short recap of previous content (15min)
3. Introduction to the weekly milestone (10min)
4. Introduce relevant concepts with slides and live coding (90min)

## Teaching Guidelines 
- **How little is enough?** - As educators, we want to give as little input and as little theory as possible. Ask yourself: how little is enough? We try to give only the necessary input so that the student can grasp a concept on a level that is relevant to them at the moment. As educators, we try to get off the stage and stop talking. We want to put the student and their coding practice in the center. Ask yourself: How little is enough? 
- **Context before content** - We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help to solve a bigger problem
- **I do, we do, you do** We recommend the concept _I do, we do, you do_ for live exercises in class. That means you start by showing one example (I do). Secondly, you ask the class to code along a second example (We do). Thirdly, you ask the class to try out one example by themselves (you do). 

## How to prepare
1. Review weekly milestones, the content in the gitbook, and the slides (you can find the slides in Google Drive, with a link pinned in Slack).
2. Adapt the slides to your wishes.
3. Try out the coding exercises beforehand to make sure they run.
