# Session Owner

## Introduction 
As a session owner, you lead the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md). You introduce the milestone of the week and the relevant concepts to work on it. You prepare the session and coordinate with the teaching assistant.

## How to run the Input session as Session Owner

**Before the Session:**
1. Check the class feedback form from the previous class before the session (Slack)
2. Coordinate with the teaching assistant to align needs
3. Upload class slides to Google Classroom as pdf 24h ahead of the session

**In the Session:**
1. Joins class as co-host 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Short recap of previous content (15min)
3. Introduction to the weekly milestone (10min)
4. Introduce relevant concepts with slides and live coding (90min)

## Teaching Guidelines 
- **How little is enough?** - As educators, we want to give as little input and as little theory as possible. Ask yourself: how little is enough? We try to give only the necessary input so that the student can grasp a concept on a level that is relevant to them at the moment. As educators, we try to get off the stage and stop talking. We want to put the student and their coding practice in the center. Ask yourself: How little is enough? 
- **Context before content** - We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help to solve a bigger problem
- **I do, we do, you do** We recommend the concept _I do, we do, you do_ for live exercises in class. That means you start by showing one example (I do). Secondly, you ask the class to code along a second example (We do). Thirdly, you ask the class to try out one example by themselves (you do). 

## How to prepare
1. Review weekly milestones, the content in the gitbook, and the slides (you can find the slides in Google Drive, with a link pinned in Slack).
2. Adapt the slides to your wishes.
3. Try out the coding exercises beforehand to make sure they run. 

## FAQ
- _What if it is too much content to cover?_ We fully understand this concern! Usually, the input sessions cover quite a huge range of topics, as there is only one input session per week. The idea for the input session is to give an idea of the concepts and an introduction to how to get started with the concept. The students dive deeper into the concepts by working with them during the weekly milestones. If a concept is unclear, the students have various chances to get support (Q&A session, peer-to-peer session, Support session).
- _What if I didn't manage to cover all the content?_ This happens! You can share the respective resources in Gitbook with the students to help them review the concepts that weren't covered. Furthermore, the recap week offers space to review concepts that need more clarification.
