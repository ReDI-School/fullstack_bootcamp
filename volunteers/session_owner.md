# Session Owner

## Introduction 

As a session owner, you lead the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md). You introduce the milestone of the week and the relevant concepts to work on it. You prepare the session and coordinate with the teaching assistant.

## How to run the Input session as Session Owner

**Before the Session:**

1. Check the class feedback form from the previous class before the session (Slack)
2. Review weekly milestones, the content in the gitbook, and the slides (you can find the slides in Google Drive, with a link pinned in Slack). Adapt the slides and exercise to your wishes.
3. Try out the coding exercises beforehand to make sure they run. 
4. Coordinate with the teaching assistant to align needs
5. Upload class slides to Google Classroom as pdf 24h ahead of the session

**In the Session:**

1. Joins class as co-host 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Short recap of previous content (~ 10 min)
3. Introduction to key concepts (~ 45 min)
4. Practice key concepts (~ 45 min)
5. Introduction to the weekly milestone (10min)

## Teaching Method: I Do, We Do, You Do

The "I Do, We Do, You Do" method is a teaching methdo designed to help students learn new concepts by first observing, then practicing with guidance, and finally working independently. 

- **I Do:** The teacher demonstrates the task while explaining the steps and thought process out loud. This stage is all about modeling the correct way to approach the task, making sure to highlight key concepts and techniques.
- **We Do:** The session owner walks the students through an activity. The students follow along (code or design along). This collaborative stage allows students to apply what they've seen with support, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback.
- **You Do:** Students work independently on the task. This stage allows them to practice the skill on their own.


**Example: Introducing Javascript**

- **I Do:** The teacher introduces JavaScript and demonstrates a simple script that shows an alert when a button is clicked. Key concepts like variables, functions, and events are explained briefly.
- **We Do:** The teachers walks the students through creating a function that changes a heading's color when a button is clicked. The students follow and code along. The teacher shares their screen and give the students time to code along. Together the teacher and the students write the function, select the element, and add an event listener, with the teacher guiding and asking questions to engage students.
- **You Do:** Students independently write JavaScript to change the text of a paragraph when a button is clicked in a breakout room. They practice using variables, functions, and event listeners, then share their work for feedback.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Context before content** - We experienced that explaining why a concept is important helps a lot in understanding what the concept is about. Why should you learn this concept? Try to give the context. Maybe explain where you use it in your daily work life. Or explain how this concept can help to solve a bigger problem
- **Engage with Students:** Ask questions to check understanding. Use their names and keep the tone friendly and encouraging.
- **Be Prepared, but Flexible:** Have a plan but adapt based on student needs.
- **Feedback is Key:** Provide constructive feedback to help students improve. Celebrate small wins to keep motivation high.

## Available Material 

The focus of the Input Session is to introduce the students to the milestone of the week and the relevant concepts to work on the milestone. To introduce the relevant concepts, there is the following material:
1. Slides - There is a slide deck to help you run the session and introduce the concepts. Feel free to adapt it! You find the folder pinned in Slack and in your Google Classroom. The slides contain the suggested agenda, an intro to the key concepts and a suggested exercise.
2. [Gitbook](https://redi-school-1.gitbook.io/fullstack/) - The Gitbook is our Knowledge base and helps the students to study the relevant concepts. It can also help the teachers to recap the relevant concepts. 
3. [Github](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/tree/main) - The projects and weekly milestones are in Github. 

## FAQ

- _What if it is too much content to cover?_ We fully understand this concern! Usually, the input sessions cover quite a huge range of topics, as there is only one input session per week. The idea for the input session is to give an idea of the concepts and an introduction to how to get started with the concept. The students dive deeper into the concepts by working with them during the weekly milestones. If a concept is unclear, the students have various chances to get support (Q&A session, peer-to-peer session, Support session).
- _What if I didn't manage to cover all the content?_ This happens! You can share the respective resources in Gitbook with the students to help them review the concepts that weren't covered. Furthermore, the recap week offers space to review concepts that need more clarification.
