# Q&A Guide

## Introduction
As Q&A Guide, you run the [Q&A Support Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/qa_session.md). You collect questions before the session and answer them live in a 60-minute Zoom call on Thursday.

## How to run the Q&A Session

**Before the Session:**
1. In Slack, a Q&A Thread is posted automatically on Wednesday evening (done by ReDI).
2. Check out the questions in the Q&A thread. Think about a potential solution or explanation for them.
3. Ask students for further clarification if posted questions are unclear.
4. Ask other teachers for support if you don't know how to solve it. 

**In the Session:**
1. Join the Zoom Call 5 minutes before the Session starts. 
2. Claim Host (Check out the pinned Guide in Slack on how to do so).
3. Wait until 19:05 to give everyone a chance to arrive and kick-off.
4. Answer Questions - Mention a question posted in Slack. Provide an answer or walk the students through the solution. You can ask if the student joined to check if the answer clarified their question.
5. After the session, post your answers in Slack. The students also get access to the recording.


## FAQ
- _What should I do if there are NO questions asked on Slack?_ Try to encourage the students to post questions on Slack or provide some in the session directly.
- _What if I finish early?_ You can go deeper into a particular issue or recap on a topic more extensively. However, it is fine to finish early.
- _What shall I do if there are too many questions?_ Let's start with the questions that you think could be the biggest roadblockers.
- _What if there is a student with a question that is very specific to their machine?_ Let's answer these questions last. Alternatively, ask if other teachers can support the student bilaterally on Slack. 
- _How do I handle very easy questions?_ You can provide a resource or short answer to the question and move on. 
- _Until when do students need to hand in their questions?_ Until 12:00 on Thursday. 
- _What if I cannot solve a question?_ This is absolutely normal. You can ask the other teachers on Slack to give an answer in the thread. 
- _What if the students have a technical problem? How can they share such an issue?_
- _Do we track attendance in the Q&A session?_ No, the session is optional. Therefore, we don't track attendance.
