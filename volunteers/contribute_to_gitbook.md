# How to Contribute to Gitbook 
ReDI's Gitbook is an open resource, and as such, everyone is invited to participate.

## Suggestions, Errors, and General Comments
Ask Julian from ReDI to be added as a contributor to the Gitbook. As a next step, you can create a pull request with suggested changes to the Gitbook. 

## Request a Review

Once you are a contributor in Gitbook you can make changes to the documents and request a review (as shown in the image). Once you requested a review the ReDI team sees the request, reviews it and can add it to Gitbook.
