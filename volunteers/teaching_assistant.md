# Teaching Assistant

## Introduction 

As a teaching assistant, you support the session owner in the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md). You open the Zoom call, track attendance, help answer questions, and provide support in break-out rooms.

## How to run the Input session as the Teaching Assistant

**Before the Session:**

1. Coordinates with the Session Owner before the session
2. Review the slides to be aware of the content to be covered

**In the Session:**

1. Join the Zoom class link 
2. Claim the host(with host key pinned in Slack channel)
3. Make the Session Owner co-host on Zoom (safety measure)
4. Start the recording (it is then saved automatically on the Cloud)
5. Moderation support: Keep an eye on live questions & make sure each student is given time to ask a question 
6. Breakouts: support group work/exercises
7. Tracks Attendance (> Camera on policy!)
