# Teaching Assistant

## Introduction 

As a teaching assistant, you support the session owner in the [Input Session](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/volunteers/input_session.md). You open the Zoom call, track attendance, help answer questions, and provide support in break-out rooms.
