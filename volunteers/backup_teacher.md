# Backup Teacher 

The Backup Teacher is ready to jump into the session in case one of the teachers assigned for the day should have issues or get sick. As a backup teacher, you donâ€™t need to attend the session unless an emergency arises. 

## Substitution Process:
The teacher not able to attend the sessions writes a comment on Slack (#teachers channel) explaining they cannot join the class and tag @backup teacher, asking if they can jump in. The backup and second teacher planned for the session to decide who was taking over which teaching role.
