# Welcome Guide

Congratulations for being accepted into our bootcamp! You should be proud of yourself. We are!

ReDI School's Full Stack Bootcamp aims to support you to become a professional web-developer. With a team of volunteer coaches, teachers and supporters, who work in the tech industry, we will help you learn the fundamentals of web development. During our course you will be building your own website, and you will get additional support from other professionals to prepare you for the labor market. 

To Get Started:
- Be sure to check your email for the date, time and important details for the onboarding week.
- Please read our [study manual](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/study_manual.md) to be better prepared. You can find the manual here.
- Take a quick look at our curriculum already. Get familiar with it's structure and content. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/tree/main).
- Read about ReDI's culture [here](https://github.com/ReDI-School/fullstack_bootcamp/blob/main/culture.md).
- Most of our activities are conducted online. However, since March 2020 (start of the Corona pandemic) we have been testing and fine tuning our online sessions and we are quite confident we will provide you with a high quality education experience.
- If you do not have a good working laptop, we can provide you with one that you can use as long as you are a trainee within our program. Please contact Alice in case you need one (you can find her e-mail in the cc of the e-mail you received).
